However, given its lack of flexibility and support for automation best practices, especially in the Continuous Delivery domain, the use of alternatives such as Gradle should be considered.\r\n\r\n* [Evil (Maven) Snapshots - Halil-Cem GÃ¼rsoy](http://bed-con.org/2014/files/slides/evil_snapshots-bedcon2014.pdf) \r\n\r\n## As Is (Anno 2014)\r\n* [Continuous delivery friendly Maven versions (MNG-5576) -> Fixed - Jason van Zyl](https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-5576)\r\n* [Real-world strategies for continuous delivery with Maven and Jenkins - John Ferguson Smart](http://www.slideshare.net/wakaleo/continuous-deliverywithmaven)\r\n* [Takari generations - Jason van Zyl](http://www.slideshare.net/Takari_io/takari-1)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bringing back the joy\r\n![Bringing back the joy ~](http://creativecan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/big-wave-surfing-_thumb3_thumb.jpg)\r\n* Requirements gathering\r\n  * Dave Dev says:\r\n    * _Let me use my snapshots and for the rest stay out of my way ..._ \r\n  * Oliver Ops says:\r\n    * _Freeze!
