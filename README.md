Maven extension(s) to facilitate continuously delivering microservices

## Problem statement

> Continuously delivering [microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) built by Maven is tough and painfull. 

(Anno 2014)

* [Technology radar Oktober 2012 - Thoughtworks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/maven)

> Maven has long been a staple of build automation in the Java space. However, given its lack of flexibility and support for automation best practices, especially in the Continuous Delivery domain, the use of alternatives such as Gradle should be considered.
